          <h4>Youth Alive</h4>
          <p>
            The youth ministry is movement to empower the next generation to
            follow God&apos;s plan for their life. We understand Entering
            adulthood, starting a new job, going to college, and other major
            changes in life can often leave young adults with more questions
            than answers. However, we know that if we base our life, and the
            decisions we make on the solid foundation of of God's word; He God
            promises that our life will be great, and success is guaranteed!
            Psalm 1: 1-3 Therefore, this ministry is designed for our millennial
            generation, to offer opportunities to connect, and grow in the
            relationship with God, and others, thereby making their marks in
            life.

            The Follow Up team of Winners Chapel Int. Chicago's main goal is to
            help integrate visitors into the church community. They do that by
            connecting with first timers immediately after their visit to the
            church, in order to help them settle down and also answer any
            questions they may have about the church.
