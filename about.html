          <h3>The Mandate</h3>
          <p>
            Our Mandate for ministry was received from the LORD Himself, in an
            18 hour vision. During this vision, a commission was received from
            the LORD to liberate mankind in all facets of human existence, to
            restore broken destinies, to bring healing to the infirmed. This was
            the Divine mandate received from the LORD: Now the hour has come to
            liberate the world from all oppression of the devil through the
            preaching of the word of faith, and I am sending you to undertake
            this task <br />
            <br />
            Today, testimonies of liberation through our messages, books, tapes,
            magazines and other periodicals are most humbling. The word of faith
            is working like fire for the liberation of mankind across the
            nations.

        <h3>12 pillars</h3>
        <p>
          God commissioned the presiding Bishop of this commission with a Word
          of Faith ministry to our generation. Remember Paul said, “…if the
          trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the
          battle?” (1 Cor 14:8) As a Commission, we have experienced amazing
          testimonies ever since this commission was handed down &hyphen; that
          is over thirty years now! The Holy Ghost further inspired the servant
          of God, Dr. David Oyedepo, to classify the Word of Faith He has
          committed into his hands into the specific areas of emphasis, in
          direct response to Isaiah 40:6, “The voice said, Cry. And he said,
          What shall I cry?…” He has named these 12 areas of emphasis as the 12
          Pillars of our Commission. We have crossed Jordan into power, bearing
          the ark of liberation. Here are the 12 stones, after the order of
          Joshua 4:1-8, 20-24. Having stood firm upon these twelve stones! And
          they have resulted in breakthroughs &hyphen; both for the ministry and
          all that are partakers with us, of the same grace.
